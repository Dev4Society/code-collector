<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

As developers, we surf the web looking for resources and often come across code snippets. Most of these fragments end up lost in your program's countless lines of code.

Code Collector aims to make that process easier.

<br/>

## How dois it work?

If the website you visit has a code snippet. A button will appear to capture it.
Also by accessing your account you can see, edit, delete your code snippets.
